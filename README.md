# goBiCGSTAB

goBiCGSTAB is an attempt to implement the famous biconjugate gradient stabilized method (biCGStab) with the go programming language.
The biCGStab is a numerical iterative method used to solve nonsymmetric linear systems of equations heavily used by CFD solvers.
This code was used as a learning project to get familiar with the go programming language.
